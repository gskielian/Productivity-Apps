## The lofty goal

I always have way too many tabs open, this will fix that once and for all.

With this app you can assign groups of websites and applications into different desktops, grouping them in different categories.

You can also customize the desired layout (split screen, fourths, etc.) using the "set bounds" protocol.

This is a free app under an MIT License

## Setup

1. get each of the desktop1, desktop2, etc., and place them into your Applications folder
2. drag each of desktop1, desktop2, etc., into your dock (don't worry we'll remove them later)
3. bind the desktop1 app to your actual Desktop 1 space by going to Desktop 1 via mission control, and then right clicking on desktop1 in the dock and selecting `Options -> this desktop`
4. repeat process with each of the other desktop apps...
5. Run the script  
6. feel free now to remove the apps from the dock.
7. mod the applescript for your own settings
